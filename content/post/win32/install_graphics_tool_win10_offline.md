# Graphics Tool

![edit-18e59d19bfd94450a2e7399a106cc38b-2022-11-14-13-53-33](https://img.blurredcode.com/img/edit-18e59d19bfd94450a2e7399a106cc38b-2022-11-14-13-53-33.png?x-oss-process=style/compress)

`Graphics Tool` is one of the essential components of Graphics Programming on Windows.
During the installation of Visual Studio, the installer trys to automatically install `Graphics Tool`, but things are not always going well.
In complicated network environment, such as in a company that has a strict firewall, or at the Chinese mainland which is blocked by the GFW, it is somewhat difficult to install `Graphics Tools`.

# UseWUServer = 0

This method is suitable for those who have a [WSUS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Windows-Server-Update-Services-WSUS) server in their company, and have access to the Internet.
I've encountered the situation while working for Tencent.

The clients are all configured to use a internal WSUS server, and sadl, although it seems that my client can acquire the latest updates, it cannot successfully install any `Optional Features` from the `Settings`, including the `Graphics Tools`.

So the way to solve it is to temporarily redirect our WSUS to the official M$ server and install what we need, and then  restore the configuration.


- Open `regedit`, go to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU`, change the value of `UseWUServer` to 0, which disables the user-defined WSUS.
- Open Administrator cmd, call `net stop wuauserv && net start wuauserv` to restart `windows update` service.
- Install `Graphics Tools` from `Settings` -> `Optional Features`.
- reset `UseWUServer` to 0, restart the WU service.


# Offline installer

The above method requires access to the M$ server, which is not the case when working in a completely offline environment.
That's the case when my client is behind a firewall and only a small whitelist are allowed, and of course, Microsoft is not on the list.

I must point out M$ doesn't provide any available solution for this case.
They boastfully stats that these `Optional Features` can be installed from [a seperate `Features On Demand` ISO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities?view=windows-11), but no one(perhaps excluding Windows developers) knows where to download the ISO.
It seems the ISOs are only provided to some OEMs and not distributed publicly.

The only way I found is provided in this article 

> Reference：[How to install Windows 10 1809 “Features On Demand” Without Internet Access – vCloudInfo](https://www.vcloudinfo.com/2019/01/how-to-install-windows-10-1809-features.html)

In a nutshell, When installing optional features, Windows Update downloads the installer, install it, and then automatically delete the installer.
Therefore, we can quickly copy the installer out in a very short time window(about several seconds) between it is fully downloaded and it gets deleted.
Luckily, we can try infinite times by uninstalling and reinstalling the feature.

After trying about 5 times, I finally captured an complete `Graphics Tools` installer.
It is captured on a `Windows 10 22H2` system, but I positively guess it is going to work across versions.
Anyway, the method mentioned before is universal.

1. Download the [Microsoft-OneCore-Graphics-Tools-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~.cab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y_rxOWz1ClqSCR4PHIGutN8fz-dHHzly/view?usp=drivesdk) to a favourite directory
2. At that directory, Open shell. Make sure your curret directory is same with the `cab`
3. Employ DISM to install it locally. 

```
DISM /online /add-package /packagepath:Microsoft-OneCore-Graphics-Tools-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~.cab`
```

Check the DebugLayer dlls are installed.
