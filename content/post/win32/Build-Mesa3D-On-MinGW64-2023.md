# Background

It's been a long time since I wrote the first line of OpenGL code.
However, I've never read the implementation or debugging in driver.

Mesa3D is a hodgepodge of **Open Source** driver implementation, and is widely used on Linux Desktop.
It's a good place to start.

# For Linux Users

I miss my old golden days of working on Linux Desktops.
It's trivial to compile it on Linux, just follow the official tutorials and it should be OK.

## For WSL1 Users

Don't waste time on it. It's not worth it.

> Ref：[Does WSL support openGL? · Issue #2855 · microsoft/WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/2855)

The Mesa3D compiles on WSL1. I managed to run `glxgears` on it, and that's all.

Its X11 environment is tricky, and GLFW/SDL may refuse to work.
I ran into the same problem in the following article on OpenGL programs with GLFW on WSL1 using `vcxsrv` and wasted some time on it, and then gave up.

> Ref：[OpenGL Development on WSL: From Setting Up to Giving Up (And What I Learned) - I'm Bowen](https://bowenzhai.ca/2018/04/15/OpenGL-Development-on-WSL-From-Setting-Up-to-Giving-Up-And-What-I-Learned/)

# PreBuilt Binaries on Win32

There is a shortcut for just using, debugging and reading Mesa3D on Windows.

> Ref：[Releases · pal1000/mesa-dist-win](https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases)

Some good guys provide prebuilt binaries for Mesa3D on Windows, with debugging symbols and MinGW64/MSVC variants.
Whatsmore, it provides hand-to-hand tutorials and some useful scripts on how to deploy it.
Also, its `README` is a good reference about the components of Mesa3D.
As I said before, Mesa3D consists of many drivers and components, and only some of them are useful, depending on the use cases.

The problem with this solution is that it's not easy to tweak and tune the code, and then see what happens.
With debugging symbols we can step into the code, but cannot modify it and do some experiments.

Some detail steps about this solution:

1. Download prebuilt binaries with debugging symbols and its corresponding source tarbar from [archive.mesa3d.org](https://archive.mesa3d.org/)
2. Place the dlls/pdbs into the same dir of the executable needs. I personally use codebase from `LearnOpenGL` as a starting point.

## Visual Studio 

If `Visual Studio` is used, one way to debug is to run executable with `Bat` script(makesure opengl32.dll and PDBs are in same dir with the executable)

```bat
@set MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.5
@set LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose
@set GALLIUM_DRIVER=llvmpipe
@TestProject.exe
```

With VS to attach to the process, and set breakpoints, then step into OpenGL calls. 
Visual Studio may pop a window asking for the location of the source code, select the source code dir we downloaded/extracted earlier.
And it should be able to step into the code.


## Visual Studio Code

Another way is to use `launch.json` in `Visual Studio Code` for debugging. 
It's more convenient when programmers are developing applications using `VSCode`.

The key configuration is `SourceFileMap` to provide the actual source code in **OUR** disks.
```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "(Windows) Launch",
            "type": "cppvsdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "<Path-To-Debug-Executable>",
            "args": [""],
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "cwd": "${fileDirname}",
            "environment": [
                {"name": "LIBGL_DEBUG","value":"verbose"},
                {"name": "GALLIUM_DRIVER","value":"llvmpipe"},
                {"name": "MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE","value":"4.5"},
            ],
            "console": "externalTerminal",
            "symbolSearchPath": "<Path-To-PDBs, e.g.: D\\mesa\\mesa3d-23.0.0-debug-info-msvc\\x64>",
            "sourceFileMap": {
                "C:\\Software\\mesa": "D:\\mesa\\mesa-23.0.0"
            }
        }

    ]
}
```


# Build On MinGW64

It's a little bit annoying to build Mesa3D on Windows, because it depends on `LLVM`, a big monster.
I decide to use MinGW64 environment provided by [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
It provides many prebuilt binaries and a perfect `Pacman` package manager.

The environments are now permutations of `Toolchain(gcc/clang)`, `Architecture(x86_64/i686/arm64)` and `C Runtime(MSVCRT/UCRT)`.
I use `MinGW64-x86_64-ucrt64` variant as the environment.
There are some Introduction about the permutations([Environments - MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/)), but it is still a mess.
In fact, I'm also confused about `UCRT/MSVCRT`.
All my knowledge is ucrt is newer and better(told by Microsoft), and only God and M$ guys know if it's true.


## Install Dependencies
```
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-pip
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake
pacman -S --noconfirm flex bison
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-clang
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-directx-headers
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-glslang
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-dlfcn
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-freeglut
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-make mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-glfw
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-vulkan-devel
python -m pip install meson mako
```

1. Download Mesa code from (https://archive.mesa3d.org/), and extract it.

2. run follow commands, there are many options available, see `meson_options.txt` for details.
For me `software rasterizer` are enough.

```sh
meson setup build/ -Dprefix=/c/tmp/mesa --buildtype=debug -Dgallium-drivers=swrast -Dvulkan-drivers=swrast
meson install -C build/
```

3. (Optional) For testing, why not use our favorite `glxgears`

```sh
// downlaod windows-ported glxgears
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrWilq/windows-glxgears/master/glxgears/main.cpp
// using MinGW64 to build it
g++ main.cpp -O glxgears -lopengl32 -lgdi32
```
copy built dlls to the `glxgears` dir and using MinGW64 shell to run.

4. (Optional)  If we want to run executable without MinGW64 shell, we need to copy some dlls from `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` to the dll. 
These dlls are depencies, and their dir is appended in `PATH` when MinGW64 shell is present.
copy following dlls from `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` to `C:\tmp\mesa\bin`, this is a workaround for MinGW64 environment.

```
libiconv-2.dll
libintl-8.dll
libsystre-0.dll
libtre-5.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll
libzstd.dll
zlib1.dll
```
